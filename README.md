## July 24, 2015
- Created agent-pending-blasts-empty.html 
- Created agent-shared-blasts.empty.html

(note: the alert had no padding on top. I considered adding the padding to the top of the tabbed-content div, but I figured that might mess up your existing styles. I temporarily just added a new div with a set height to act as a vertical spacer.)
